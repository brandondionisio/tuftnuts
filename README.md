Tuft Nuts is a fun, student-driven app that lets Tufts students post, track, and 
share real-time squirrel sightings on campus. With a live squirrel map, photo 
uploads for the most famous campus squirrels, and the ability to like your
favorite squirrel sightings, TuftNuts turns our love for Tufts'furry mascots 
into an interactive community experience. Whether you're spotting a daredevil 
squirrel mid-heist or just capturing a wholesome moment, TuftNuts brings 
students togetherâ€”one acorn at a time!

REFLECTION
The Nutter Butters were inspired by the friendly woodland creatures that inhabit
our lovely Tufts University campus. We wanted to give them proper recognition
for their silly presence while creating an opportunity to foster community among
Jumbos. 

Some features that we would love to implement in the future are the
the ability to comment on squirrel sightings as well as a leaderboard for some
friendly competition to see who can gather the most acorns. 

A challenge that we encountered was figuring out how to integrate the Apple Maps
API so that each squirrel post could be seen as a cute squirrel head in the 
same location from which the photo was taken.

A totally tubular experience we had with other hackers was waiting in the 
dinner line for Bob's. We really felt bonded with our fellow hackers in that 
moment.
